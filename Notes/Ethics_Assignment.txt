You and your design group are competing for a multidisciplinary concept 
project
. Your 
firm is the lead group in the design professional consortium 
formed 
to compete 
for the project. Your consortium has been selected to 
be the first to 
enter fee 
negotiations with the project owner. During 
negotiations, the amount you 
have to 
cut from your fee to be awarded the 
contract will require dropping one of 
the consortium 
members whose staff 
has special capabilities not found in the staff 
of the 
remaining consortium 
members

your consortium response in the negotiations ethical?
–
(A) No, not if the owner is left with the impression that the consortium is still 
fully qualified

(B) Yes, if your remaining consortium members hire a few new, lower 
cost 
employees 
to do the special work originally intended to be provided by 
the 
consortium 
member dropped.

(C) No, because an engineer may not accept a contract to coordinate a 
project

personwill

Juan is an EIT working as an electrical engineer for 
a consulting 
company that designs switch gears 
for small 
substations. His 
supervisor asks him 
to duplicate 
a set of drawings, changing the 
name 
of the 
client. He explains that a new client has 
a substation 
with identical specifications to the 
last project 
Juan worked on, so 
the same design 
will work
. When Juan asks how he should bill his 
time
, he 
is told to enter the same number of hours 
he billed 
for the 
initial design work. Juan’s 
response should 
be
:
–
(A) “
It took me two weeks to design the earlier project
, so 
I should 
wait two weeks before submitting 
this design 
to justify the charged 
hours”
–
(B) “
The Code of Ethics requires that a second use of 
a design 
be done 
by a different engineer”

consent”

I’ll need to do some research to make sure 
the specifications 
are 
really identical

You and your design group are competing for a 
multi
-
disciplinary project
. 
Your firm is the lead group of a consortium 
formed to

contract. Your consortium has 
been selected 
as the first to enter fee 
negotiations with the

never actually graduated due to 
failing a 
required last
-
