Standards Used

RISC-V User-level ISA Specification, version 2.2:
	We wrote our processor code to implement the ISA per these specifications.

RISC-V Privileged ISA Specification Draft, version 1.10:
	We wrote our processor code to adhere to the privilege mode
	conventions described in these specifications.

VHDL IEEE std 1076-1993:
	The Vivado IDE only fully supports the 1993 standard for VHDL.  All
	our system components and processor code made use of this standard.

DDR Memory Specification:
	The DDR specification guided our work on interacting with the DDR2 memory on the Nexys4.
	
AXI4 Protocol:
	This protocol is the standardized interface to various IP modules used in the MMU.
	
UART Serial Protocol:
	This protocol is used by our debugger unit to communicate register contents, and by the system to take inputs from a keyboard and produce output for the terminal.
	
Linux Kernel version 4.12.0:
	We used this Linux kernel as a starting point to build our binary for the system.
	
Busybox version 1.26.2:
	We used this software as our terminal and interface to the operating system.
