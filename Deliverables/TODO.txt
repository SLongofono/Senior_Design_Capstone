Deliverables EECS542

Some of these are part of the final report (x).

Friday 3/30:
	(x) Standards used - see email
	if we used any protocols or standards, make an itemized list with what and how it was used.  Minimal detail.

4/6:
	(x) Design constraints/requirements
	list out any particular constraints (costs, real-time, memory size, limits, etc.) ~ half page.
	Ex - omitting FP ops, keeping atommic isolated, simplified pipeline, ALU pipeline, functional testing

4/13:
	(x) Alternate designs considered
	Any components/designs that we made choices about, describe the decision and the alternates, and justify.
	
4/20:
	(x) Issues encountered from design stage to end-of-life
	Define maintenance, updates, end-of-life aspects of the project, should it be released as a product.  This is
	more of a thought experiment.  What kind of support should/would be provided to make it a more attractive
	product.  Include nice-to-have or stretch goals as upgrades, as well as what circumstances would lead to the
	end-of-life

4/27:
	(x) Ethical concerns - what would the consumer of your product need to know?  What situations are important, and what
	assumptions are made about its use?  Are there any environmental concerns.  What concerns are we obligated to communicate
	to non-technical users (given that they may never think about such matters).  What conditions have we tested under,
	communicate any known issues or points of failure.

	Awards ceremony and present to advisory board if selected.

5/1:
	Poster design due - quad chart style - Objective, team, overview, implementation
	Final presentation is a 10-minute video.  Best of which gets $400 prize?

5/12:
	Present after the recognition ceremony
