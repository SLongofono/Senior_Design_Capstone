# Senior_Design_Capstone
Sandbox repo for my senior design capstone project.  More to come.

Plan: Implement a RISC-V processor running a pared-down version of Linux.  Use the RV64G extension of RISC-V.

Semester Goals:
  Cesar:  Serial to USB control module -> Software controllable register dumps -> core-integrated debugger
  Jacob:  Identifying what needs to be implmented for Linux
  Stephen:Serial Core implmentation of RISCV for the 64G extension set
